   RUF EXTRACT HOWTO
=========================

Extract DriftBox & PerformanceBox RUF files.
It has not been tested with other firmware images, feel free to try it out.

How to compile:
=============== 

make all

You need to have zlib1g-dev installed. apt-get is your friend.

How to use:
===========

./ruf_extract <FIRMWARE.RUF>

Usually 3 files will be dumped:

 chunk_21.dat - 9 Bytes Long - seems to contain a string C00000000 (DriftBox) N00000000 (Perf Box)
 chunk_30.dat - XXXX Bytes Long - contains an Intel HEX File, obviously the firmware. Checkout "strings chunk_30.dat" 
 chunk_XXXX.dat - Where X depends on the size of chunk_30.dat - contains 4096 bytes of 0x0
