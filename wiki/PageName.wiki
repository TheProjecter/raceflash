#Basic operation of firmware upgrade process

= Basic Operation =

The bootloader is located at 0x40000000-0x40007FFF (=32KB) of usable flash memory.
It emulates a usbser.sys Serial Port with 115.2k/8/N/1 and responds only to certain messages.
No output is happening until you 'wake' it.

= Steps =

<LI>Say Hello/Get Model type & serial number
<LI>Get the SEED from the device
<LI>Send the calculated key back to the device. (this really unlocks the bootloader flash application)
<LI>Erase the flash areas
<LI>Upload the new firmware to 0x40008000 onwards.
<LI>Save the FLASH-Key to 0x400C3FFC, without it the bootloader will not start the uploaded firmware
<LI>Close communication (reboot device)
